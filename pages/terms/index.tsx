          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to Proxy IRAS, your comprehensive solution for managing
            academic tasks seamlessly. Designed with the modern student
            environment in mind, our platform offers a simplified yet powerful
            alternative to the traditional university management system. As you
            have just clicked our Terms of Use, please pause, grab a cup of
            coffee and carefully read the following pages. It will take you
            approximately 10 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains

          <p>
            At the heart of our platform it is integrated with our
            university&apos;s existing management system (iras v1 / iras v2 /
            iras v3), leveraging its robust REST API to fetch essential details
            such as course information, student profiles, and class schedules.
            This ensures that you have access to the most up-to-date and
            accurate information at your fingertips, making academic planning
            and scheduling effortless.
          </p>
          <p>
            But we didn&apos;t stop there. Recognizing the growing importance of
            digital learning platforms, we&apos;ve bridged the gap between our
            university&apos;s curriculum and Google Classroom. By integrating
            Google Classroom&apos;s API into our platform, we&apos;ve enabled
            seamless access to course materials, assignments, and personal
            insights—all within an unified interface. A student who is looking
            to stay organized, aiming to enhance the learning experience,or
            seeking efficient management tools, Proxy IRAS is here to simplify
            your academic journey.
